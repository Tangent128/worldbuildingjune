A Markov name generator for worldbuilding inspiration,
or just plain fun.

I may add other toys later if any come to mind;
but this was mainly an experiment in learning TypeScript.

On that note, you'll need `tsc` (the Typescript compiler)
and `uglifyjs` to produce the bundles that `markov.html` expects.
I think `npm` will install them for you if your operating system
lacks those packages.
